* If well designed, should be modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable.

_____What are the characteristics of a component?_____

* Reusable : able to be plugged into multiple areas after beng developed once.

* Replaceable : Can be updated without breaking code.

* Non-Content Specific : Will work even with flexible content within.

* Extensible : Able to be extended from current state to take on other roles

* Encapsulated : Component will depict an interface so users may call on functionality.

* Independent : Component is designed with a self-reliant buildout so surrounding code may be changed.
