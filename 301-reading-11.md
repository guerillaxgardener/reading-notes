List five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

1. SQL called as a Relational Database while NoSQL called as a non-relational or distributed database

2. SQL is table based database NoSQL is doc based key:value pairs, graph DBs, or wide-column stores

3. SQL = pre-determined schema. NoSQL = dynamic schema to better work with unstructured data

4. SQL = vertically scalable, NoSQL horizontally scalable

5. SQL scale managed by increasing CPU, RAM, SSD, etc. NoSQL scaled by adding servers into database

What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

* Structured data

Give a real world example.

A high transaction application like Venmo woiuld be good in SQL

What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
