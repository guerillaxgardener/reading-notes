What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

## [Employee breakdown of key technology companies](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/)

What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?

* HP and Dell are both filled with a much higher percentage white people in a country that is 61% white. Their perspectives on things likely suffer a lot from this lack of diversity.

* Only 6% of our fortune 500 CEO's are women, so 94% of them are men. These CEO's are also 73% white. So, our societies' most influential companies, which due to our laws are extremely influential in lobbying and thus writing the rules for the government is primarily men, and also mostly white. Clearly a problem.

* The Federal Government being lobbied by that CEO group is also made up of 80% white people.
