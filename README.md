### What is **Growth Mindset** to me?

I believe **growth mindset** is a belief in ones own ability to learn, while being confident that **confusion and faiure are just paths towards growth and eventual success**, instead of seeing these challenges as [evidence](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uZ1ZeLc-qjA/maxresdefault.jpg) of one's inability. 

#### How to keep myself in a growth mindset:
,,,
* See challenges as opportunities to learn
* Proper diet, eat, sleep, and frequent breaks
* Considstently show up to practice and learn everyday.
