## About Me

Hello, my name is Michael and I love learning! Some of my favorite things to practice and learn about are skateboarding, rock climbing, gardening, and my recent learning conquest have brought me here to learn software development through Code Fellow's Training Academy.

### What is **Growth Mindset** to me?

I believe a **growth mindset** is a belief in one's own ability to learn while being confident that **confusion and failure are just paths towards growth and eventual success**, instead of seeing these challenges as [evidence](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uZ1ZeLc-qjA/maxresdefault.jpg) of one's inability. 

#### How I'll keep myself in a growth mindset:
```
* See challenges as opportunities to learn
* Proper diet, eat, sleep, and frequent breaks
* Consistently show up to practice and learn every day.
```
