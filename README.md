### ___What is Growth Mindset to me?___

I believe a **growth mindset** is a belief in one's own ability to learn while being confident that **confusion and failure are just paths towards growth and eventual success**, instead of seeing these challenges as [evidence](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uZ1ZeLc-qjA/maxresdefault.jpg) of one's inability.

### ___How I'll keep myself in a growth mindset:___

```text
* See challenges in development as opportunities to learn

* Proper diet, eat, sleep, and frequent breaks

* Show up to practice coding every day.

```
