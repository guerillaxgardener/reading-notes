## What is **Growth Mindset** to me?

I believe **growth mindset** is a belief in ones own ability to learn, while being confident that **confusion and faiure are just paths towards growth and eventual success**, instead of seeing these challenges as evidnce of one's inability. 

### How to keep myself in a growth mindset:

* See challenges as opportunities to learn
* Proper diet, eat, sleep, and frequent breaks
* Considstently show up to practice and learn everyday.
