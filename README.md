### What is **Growth Mindset** to me?

I believe a **growth mindset** is a belief in one's own ability to learn while being confident that **confusion and failure are just paths towards growth and eventual success**, instead of seeing these challenges as [evidence](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uZ1ZeLc-qjA/maxresdefault.jpg) of one's inability. 

#### How I'll keep myself in a growth mindset:
```
* See challenges as opportunities to learn
* Proper diet, eat, sleep, and frequent breaks
* Consistently show up to practice and learn every day.
```
