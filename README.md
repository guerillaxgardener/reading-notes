## What is Growth Mindset to me?

I believe growth mindset is a belief in ones own ability to learn, while being confident that confusion and faiure are just paths towards growing and succeeding at the process at hand. 

### How to keep myself in a growth mindset:

* See challenges as opportunities to learn
* Proper diet, eat, sleep, and frequent breaks
* Considstently show up to practice and learn everyday.
