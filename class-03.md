__Event:__ gets fired or raised to trigger the code

> ex: click, submit, mouse over, mouse down, key press

__Code:__ Gets triggered

* Event Listener : listens for an event like clcking and activates the *event handler* code.

* Event Handler : Code that runs n response to event listener

### How WE SHALL DO THIS

> `element.addEventListener('event', callback function);` like "keyPress", "click", etc

* *Callback Function* = function that is passed in as an argument to another function

* declaring a function and passing n a callback will run callback functon along with other funtion.

> EX: `button.addEventListener('submit', handleSubmit)

___*Event Bubbling:*___ This is what we often see, which features overlapping bubbles of events

* ___Event listener___ will be placed on outter bubble (bubbles can be thought of as HTML section boxes) -->
