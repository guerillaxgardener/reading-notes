# Class 1: [Learning Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

#### In the first lesson, we learned about using Markdown on github; this gives us a simple way to format text within a plain-text editor.

## Major Formatting Tools Within Markdown:

> ##### **Headings**
>> using different quantities of number signs allow us to change the heading size of the text to create a better overall formatting.
> ##### **Paragraphs**
>> Paragraphs are created within Markup by simply separating text with a blank line. 
>> Best practice is to leave paragraphs left-aligned and resist our urge to indent as this may result in formatting errors. 
> ##### **Headings**
