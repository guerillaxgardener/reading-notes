# Class 1: [Learning Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

#### In the first lesson, we learned about using Markdown on github; this gives us a simple way to format text within a plain-text editor.

## Major Formatting Tools Within Markdown:

> ##### **Headings**
>> using different quantities of number signs \(#) allow us to change the heading size of the text to create a better overall formatting.


> ##### **Paragraphs**
>> Paragraphs are created within Markup by simply separating text with a blank line. <br> Best practice is to leave paragraphs left-aligned and resist our urge to indent as this may result in formatting errors. 


> ##### **Line Breaks**
>> We can make our text break from the current line and begin tryping on the next line using a double space or using the html format \<br> in order to make it easier for others reading your code to see line breaks within the code. 


> ##### **Emphasis**
>> using **bold** or _italicized_ text is an important tool to emphasize compared with plain-text.


> ##### **Lists**
>> We can create ordered or non ordered lists, to create an ordered list simply start each line with a number and period, the numbers must start with one, but do not need to be in numerical order after this. 
>> EX:
>>>    1. cat
>>>    2. dog
>>>    5. michael
>>>    9. cheese
>>>    57. sausage
>>>    87239472. hogwarts
