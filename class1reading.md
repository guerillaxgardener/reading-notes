# Class 1: [Learning Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

#### In the first lesson, we learned about using Markdown on github; this gives us a simple way to format text within a plain-text editor.

## Major Formatting Tools Within Markdown:

> ##### **Headings**
>> using different quantities of number signs allow us to change the heading size of the text to create a better overall formatting.


> ##### **Paragraphs**
>> Paragraphs are created within Markup by simply separating text with a blank line. <br> Best practice is to leave paragraphs left-aligned and resist our urge to indent as this may result in formatting errors. 


> ##### **Line Breaks**
>> We can make our text break from the current line and begin tryping on the next line using a double space or using the html format #<br> in order to make it easier for others reading your code to see line breaks within the code.
