# Class 6 Reading: Dynamic Webpages with [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

## __Javascript__ : a lightweight compiled programming language with first-class functions.
> first-class fn: This means that commands within this language are treated like any other variable.

* Javascript's primary use is in creatign the language for webpages, but it is also used in many non browser environments.

## Input/Output in Javascript

> `input` elements in HTML prompt the user with a requested input which can then be fed into code and given as output.
> to utilize a user input, the method is often creating a `function` to do whatever job we seek, then to feed user input into function.

## Many templating systems exist for Javascript to make the process less cumbersome

## [Javascript Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp)

> These are containers that we use for storing data within Javascript.

### There are four ways to declare a variable in Javascript

1. using `var`
2. using `let`
3. using `const`
4. using nothing

> EX: `var x = 17;`
>
> EX: `let y = 22;`
>
> EX: `const x=5`

### Javascript Identifiers

> These are the unique names we give when defining variables and all variables must be unique.
>
>Identifiers are __Case Sensitive__

## Assignment Operator (`=`)

> In Javascript, the equal (`=`) sign is the assignment operator, unlike in algebra, this assigns something to a value. 
>
> If we want to find out what something equals, we use two equal signs in Javascript (`==`)

## Javascript Variable Data Types

> variables can take numbers or strings as inputs.
>
>> numbers : `0, 1, 2, 3`
>>
>> strings: `"michael", "1", "yes"`
