## Functions
___
### MDN Control Flow : the order that a computer executes statements in a script

> code runs from first line to last without other circumstances altering this flow, like a loop.

### Javascript Functions : Blocks of code that perform different specified tasks. 

> These functions must be 'called' upon before running.

### Syntax of Javascript Functions

> `function` + `"name_of_function"` + `()`
>
>> __Parameters__ are placed inside parentheses
>>
>> __Values__ received when function is invoked are called __arguments__

### Benefits of Functions
> you can reuse code after defining it one time!
> may use the function value as input to a variable's value.
