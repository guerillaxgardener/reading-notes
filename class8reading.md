# Class 8 Reading: Operators and Loops


## Operators


### Comparison Operators : Compares operands and returns a logical value based on whether comparison is true.

* Equal : (`==`) Returns true if operands are equal
* Not Equal : (`!=`) Returns true if operands are not equal
* Strict Equal : (`===`) Returns true if operands equal and the same type
* Strict not equal : (`!==`) Returns true if the operands are of the same type but not equal.
* Greater Than : (`>`) Returns true if left operand is greater than right operand
* Less Than : (`<`) Returns true if left operand is lower than right operand

### Assignment Operators : Assign value to left operand based on right operand

* Assignment : (`x=f()`) means x=f()
* Many additional [assignment operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#assignment_operators) exist to aid us in being more flexible with assigning values.

## Loops : Offer a quick way to repeat something many times quickly

* `For` Loop : This loop repeats until the spoecified condition evaluates as `false`.
> `for ([initial expression]; [conditional expression]; [increment expression]`
`expression`

* `While` Loop : Executes the loop as long as the condition is evaluated as `true`
> `while (condition)
    statement`
